Structure of a Python script
============================

There is a standard structure recommended for Python scripts:

1. imports
2. constants
3. functions and classes
4. ``__main__`` block

Example
-------

The following program contains most of these elements

.. code:: python3

   from pprint import pprint

   MESSAGE = "Good morning {}. Nice to see you!"

   def hello(name):
       """Writes a hello world message"""
       msg = MESSAGE.format(name)
       pprint(msg)

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       name = input("please enter your name: ")
       hello(name)

----

Imports
-------

All import statements should be grouped together at the beginning of a
Python file. If you have lots of imports, a standard for sorting them
might be useful. The tools **isort** and **black** help with that.

----

Constants
---------

In Python, constants do not exist as a syntax element.
But it is a good practice to group variables
*“that the programmer does not intend to change”*.

These constants should be written in capitals to distinguish them from
variables that change during their lifetime:

.. code:: python3

    PI = 3.14159

----

Function and class definitions
------------------------------

Functions and classes should be defined in nested-first-order. That
means functions called by other functions go first, functions called
from the main program only go last.

----

The **main** block
------------------

At the end of the program, there is a strange construct: The
``if __name__ == '__main__':`` block indicates the main program.

The ``__main__`` block is only executed when you run the entire program
with ``python my_program.py`` (or the equivalent in your editor).
However, it is **not** executed when you import functions or classes
from it. This way you can have a main program and reusable functions in
the same file.

It you can keep an entire code block here, or only call a ``main()``
function. Sometimes the ``__main__`` block is used for other things
(e.g. test code).
