Tetris

In :download:`tetris.py`, you find a complete Tetris game.
It makes heavy use of the Numpy library.
The code was created in a coding speedrun; it almost has no structure.

.. note::

   There is also a bug when dropping long bricks to the ground.
   Maybe some refactoring makes this issue easier to debug.
