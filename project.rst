Project: Implement a Game
=========================

.. topic:: Goal

    **Implement a computer game in Python.**

    Get together in a team of 2-3. 
    Find an idea for a game that you would like to implement.
    Then implement it.

Some ideas
----------

- a text adventure with pictures (see `Quest for the Dragon Egg <http://www.academis.eu/python_basics/challenges/text_adventure.html>`__)
- Connect Four
- a Candy Crush-like game
- a Tetris-like game
- Pac man/woman/non-binary

.. hint::

   A smaller idea implemented well is worth more than a large program that is left half-finished.

- there are 3+ automated tests that pass
- the project uses Continuous Integration
- Python style checks pass
- the project is pip-installable
- the game contains custom graphics
- the game contains sound effects and/or music
