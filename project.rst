Project: Implement a Game
=========================

.. topic:: Goal

    **Implement a computer game in Python.**

    Get together in a team of 2-3. 
    Find an idea for a game that you would like to implement.
    Then implement it.

Some ideas
----------

- a text adventure with pictures (see `Quest for the Dragon Egg <http://www.academis.eu/python_basics/challenges/text_adventure.html>`__)
- Connect Four
- a Candy Crush-like game
- a Tetris-like game
- Pac man/woman/non-binary

.. hint::

   A smaller idea implemented well is worth more than a large program that is left half-finished.

Assessment Criteria
-------------------

- the game is working
- there is a git repository
- there is a README file including installation instructions
- there is a ``requirements.txt`` or ``pyproject.toml`` file
- no functions is longer than 20 lines
- there is at least one class with 3+ attributes and/or methods
- there is a class diagram, sequence diagram, state diagram or other type of design diagram
- there are 3+ automated tests that pass and check the code of the game
- the project uses Continuous Integration
- Python style checks with black pass
- at least 3 functions contain type annotations
- the game contains custom graphics
- the game contains sound effects and/or music
- great gameplay (up to 2 points)

.. warning::

    When submitting a project as a piece of academic work, you must make sure to reference:

    - sources of images, animations and music
    - projects the code is based upon
    - tutorials that were directly used
    - large language models (LLMs) that were used to generate artwork or code

    Failure to comply may consist a plagiarism case and may violate the rights of copyright holders.
