Metaclasses
===========

Metaclasses change the objects creation mechanics in Python.

The when Python creates an object, it calls the ``__new__()`` method of
the metaclass. The default behavior of ``__new__()`` is that it creates
an instance and calls its ``__init__()``. Now you could write a new
metaclass that instead of calling ``__init__()`` does something else.

Valid Use Cases for changing a metaclass are:

-  writing an ORM like **Django models** or **SQLAlchemy**
-  hijacking internal Python logic (e.g.Â like **pytest** does)
-  emulating JavaScript-like objects (the Prototype pattern)

Throughout 20 years of Python programming, I have not come across a
single situation where writing a metaclass was necessary. But it helps
to understand Python on a deeper level.

Example
-------

**WARNING: This code is a complex illustrative example that might drive
you nuts!**

1. run the code
2. admire what is happening
3. try to understand what is happening
4. return to 1

Here is the code

.. code:: python3

   class CrazyMonkeyPack(type):

       def __new__(mcs, name, bases, dict):
           cls = type.__new__(mcs, name, bases, dict)

           def wrapper(*args):
               instance = []
               for i in range(1, args[0]+1):
                   monkey = cls(f'monkey #{i}')  # calls __init__
                   monkey.state = 'crazy'  # monkey-patches the state attribute
                   instance.append(monkey)
               return instance

           return wrapper


   class CrazyMonkeys(metaclass=CrazyMonkeyPack):
       """A self-expanding horde of monkeys"""
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def __repr__(self):
           return f"<{self.name} ({self.state})>"


   monkeys = CrazyMonkeys(3)  # calls __new__
   print(monkeys)             # see what happens!

Final Warning
-------------

Don't try using metaclasses at work, unless

-  you have excluded all alternatives
-  you really know what you are doing
-  you have talked to a developer more experienced than you
