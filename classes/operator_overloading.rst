Operator Overloading
====================

In Python, classes can have **many** ``__magic_methods__()`` â€“ those
that start and end with a double underscore. All ``__magic_methods__()``
have a special function and should never be called directly. Most of
them directly map to Python operators. Here are some examples:

============== =================================================
method         description
============== =================================================
``__init__()`` called when creating an object from a class
``__repr__()`` called when converting object to a string
``__add__()``  called when using the ``+`` operator on an object
``__mul__()``  called when using the ``*`` operator on an object
``__gt__()``   called when comparing the object to another
``__len__()``  called when using ``len()``
``__hash__()`` called when using the object as a dictionary key
============== =================================================

It is often questionable, whether overloading operators is a good idea.
Many times it is not, because it obscures what is happening behind the
scenes.

Compare the clarity of:

.. code:: python3

   a = vec1 * vec2
   b = vec1 @ vec2

versus

.. code:: python3

   a = vec1.dot_product(vec2)
   b = vec1.scalar_product(vec2)

Below you find two examples that I have found useful:

--------------

Sortable Objects
----------------

The method ``__gt__(self, other)`` is implicitly called when comparing
two objects, as done by any sorting algorithm.

.. code:: python3

   class Elephant:
       """Elephants that sort themselves by trunk size"""
       def __init__(self, name, trunk_size):
           self.name = name
           self.trunk_size = trunk_size

       def __repr__(self):
           return f"<{self.name} [trunk {self.trunk_size}]>"

       def __gt__(self, other):
           return self.trunk_size < other.trunk_size

   elephants = [
       Elephant('mama', 5),
       Elephant('baby', 1),
       Elephant('grandma', 7),
       Elephant('daddy', 6),
       Elephant('son', 3),
   ]

   from pprint import pprint

   pprint(elephants)

   print("\nAnd now the biggest elephants go first:")
   elephants.sort()

   pprint(elephants)

--------------

Hashable Vectors
----------------

This is a 2D vector class I used for screen positions in a game. I
wanted the vectors to be capable of simple arithmetics. They also needed
to be hashable (which NumPy arrays are not).

.. code:: python3

   class Vector:

       def __init__(self, x, y):
           self.x = x
           self.y = y

       def __add__(self, other):
           x = self.x + other.x
           y = self.y + other.y
           return Vector(x, y)

       def __sub__(self, other):
           x = self.x - other.x
           y = self.y - other.y
           return Vector(x, y)

       def __mul__(self, n):
           '''scalar multiplication'''
           # considered unclean - for illustration only
           x = self.x * n
           y = self.y * n
           return Vector(x, y)

       def __hash__(self):
           return str(self).__hash__()

       def __repr__(self):
           return f'[{self.x};{self.y}]'


   UP = Vector(0, -1)
   LEFT = Vector(-1, 0)
   UPLEFT = UP + LEFT
   FAST_UP = UP * 3

   messages = {
     UP: 'moving up',
     LEFT: 'moving left',
   }
