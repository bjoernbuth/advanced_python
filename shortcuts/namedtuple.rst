Named Tuples
============

The ``namedtuple`` type is a shortcut for structuring data. A
``namedtuple`` has fixed fields. If you are thinking about creating a
class only for organizing attributes, the ``namedtuple`` is much
shorter.

You define a ``namedtuple`` by listing its attributes:

.. code:: python3

   from collections import namedtuple

   Animal = namedtuple('Animal', ('name', 'legs', 'eggs'))

   species = [
       Animal('chicken', 2, True),
       Animal('dolphin', 0, False),
       Animal('elephant', 4, False),
   ]

The attributes are available afterwards by their name. This is much
easier than indexing by numbers like in a normal tuple:

.. code:: python3

   for animal in species:
       print(f"The {animal.name} has {animal.legs} legs.")
       if animal.eggs:
         print("It is laying eggs.")
