Collections
===========

The ``collections`` module contains a few very useful dictionaries:

=========== =====================================
type        description
=========== =====================================
Counter     dictionary for counting things
defaultdict dictionary with a preset value
OrderedDict dictionary preserving insertion order
=========== =====================================

Counter
-------

The ``Counter`` is a special dictionary for counting things.

.. code:: python3

   from collections import Counter

   # generate 100 random names
   names = ["Adam", "Bea", "Charlie", "Danielle",
            "Eve", "Frantz", "Gustav", "Helena"]
   from random import choice
   data = [choice(names) for i in range(100)]

You create a ``Counter`` by giving it an iterable:

.. code:: python3

   c = Counter(data)

The most important new method is ``most_common``. The rest works like a
normal dictionary.

.. code:: python3
   print(c)
   print(c.most_common(3))
   print(c.get('Adam'))

----

Defaultdict
-----------

A ``defaultdict`` inserts a default value for each key that is used the first time. 
It therefore never throws a ``KeyError`` when requesting a value.

Creating a defaultdict
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A ``defaultdict`` is created with a function that creates the default
valued.

The following dictionary defaults to a zero integer:

.. code:: python3

   from collections import defaultdict

   d = defaultdict(int)
   d['Adam'] = 33
   d['Eve'] = 55

   print(d['Adam'])  # -> 33 like a normal dict
   print(d['Guido']) # -> 0  because it's a new key

Most times a ``defaultdict`` is initialized with a data, but any Python
function works. Try:

.. code:: python3

   from random import random

   d = defaultdict(random)
   d['dummy']

Collecting lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common use case is to create a dict of lists. This becomes very easy
with a ``defaultdict``.

The following example sorts names by their initial:

.. code:: python3

   names = [
           "Athene", "Ada", "Hypathia",
           "Anna", "Helena", "Thetis"
   ]

   d = defaultdict(list)

   for n in names:
       key = n[0]
       d[key].append(n)

This results in the following data:

.. code:: python3

   defaultdict(list,
               {'A': ['Athene', 'Ada', 'Anna'],
                'H': ['Hypathia', 'Helena'],
                'T': ['Thetis']})

----

OrderedDict
-----------

OrderedDict is a special kind of dictionary that preserves the insertion
order.

.. code:: python3

   from collections import OrderedDict

   od = OrderedDict()

   names = ["Adam", "Bea", "Charlie", "Danielle", "Eve", "Frantz", "Gustav", "Helena"]
   for i, name in enumerate(names):
        od[i] = name

With an OrderedDict, you have a guarantee that the output of the
following command is always the same (which you donâ€™t have with a normal
dictionary):

.. code:: python3

   print(od)

You have an additional method for changing the order:

.. code:: python3

   od.move_to_end(2)
   print(od)
