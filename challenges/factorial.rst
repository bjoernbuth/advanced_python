Factorials
==========

Write a recursive function that calculates factorials (n!)

.. code:: python3

   def factorial(n):
       """Returns a factorial of n."""
       pass


   # Test code
   assert factorial(0) == 1
   assert factorial(1) == 1
   assert factorial(2) == 2
   assert factorial(3) == 6
   assert factorial(7) == 5040
