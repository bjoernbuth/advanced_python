# Magic Square

**ðŸŽ¯ Solve a magic square.**

* create a magic square with 3 * 3 fields.
* fill the square with the numbers from 1-9
* the sum of the numbers in each row, column and diagonal shall be 15
* use each number only once
* print the finished square

## Hints

* Write a function that calculates all sums
* A *brute-force* approach is to try out all permutations*
* See the `itertools` module

## Extra Challenge

Fill a magic square with 4 * 4 fields with the numbers 1-16 (sum 34).

If you don't want to try all the possibilities (9!), you can describe the magic square as a linear system of equations.
The Python package **PuLP** allows you to express the necessary equations in a very compact way.
