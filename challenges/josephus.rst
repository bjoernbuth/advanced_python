   Sean Connery hunts the monk-killer

In a monastery there are 1 assassin and the following 9 monks:

.. code:: python3

   monks = [
          "Adalbertus", "Bonifacius", "Commodus",
          "Dominicus", "Emarius", "Franziskus",
          "Gustavus", "Henrik", "Iohannes"
          ]

Every night the 5th monk is murdered (counting from the 1st monk or the
last victim). The last monk catches the assassin.

Which monk will survive?
