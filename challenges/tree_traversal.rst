Tree Traversal
==============

**🎯 Output all nodes in a tree.**

Collect all living beings from the following tree structure in a single
list.

.. code:: python3

   tree3 = [
             ['Rose', 'banana tree'],
             [
               [
                 ['hammerhead shark', 'stingray'],
                 [
                   ['chimp', 'human'],
                    'rat'
                 ]
               ],
               ['bee', 'ant']
             ]
           ]

.. hint::

   **Hints:**

   -  Draw the tree. In which order would you go through the beings?
   -  How can you check whether you are dealing with a string or a list?
   -  Is it basically possible to walk trees of any depth with the same program?
   -  Research *“Tree Traversal”*
