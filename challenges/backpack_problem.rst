A burglar broke into a villa. There he finds so many valuables that he
canâ€™t put them all in his backpack. Write a program that makes an
optimal selection.

The burglar is an experienced professional who can estimate the market
value and size of each item in no time:

================ ==== ======
item             size value
================ ==== ======
laptop           2    600,-
cutlery          2    400,-
spotify speakers 3    300,-
jewels           2    1100,-
vase             5    700,-
camera           2    500,-
painting         4    900,-
cash             1    800,-
================ ==== ======

The backpack has a capacity of ``8``.

When your program manages to pack items worth ``3000``, it can be used
as an app for amateur burglars.

Hints
-----

**The optimal solution uses dynamic programming.**

Use the following pseudocode:

1.  create an empty data structure for the best combinations for each backpack size
2.  insert an empty combination for a size 0 backpack
3.  start with a size 1 backpack
4.  store the best combination for the current size minus one as ``current best``
5.  go through all items
6.  create a new combination usign an item plus the best combination for
    the space remaining
7.  if the combination is more valuable than the ``current best``,
    replace ``current best`` by the new combination
8.  if the combination is worth the same amount, save both
9.  increase the size of the backpack by 1
10. repeat step 4 until you reach the desired size
