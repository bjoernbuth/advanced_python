Dice
====

**ðŸŽ¯ Write a program that rolls two dice.**

.. figure:: double_dice.png
   :alt: double dice

Write a class ``Dice`` that:

-  displays the image of a dice
-  changes the dice image a few times (as animation effect)
-  shows a random dice result
-  stores the result as an attribute

Write a program that creates two Dice objects. Re-roll both dice until
they show the same number

Hints
-----

-  for the graphics you can use ``arcade``.
-  the function ``time.sleep(x)`` waits ``x`` seconds
-  Use the following image for the dice:

.. figure:: pillow_dice.png
   :alt: dice faces
