Write a class `Dice` that:

* displays the image of a dice
* changes the dice image a few times (as animation effect)
* shows a random dice result

Write a program that creates two Dice objects.
Re-roll both dice until they show the same number

* for the graphics you can use `arcade`.
* the function `time.sleep(x)` waits `x` seconds
* Use the following image for the dice:
