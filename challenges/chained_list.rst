Chained List
============

**ðŸŽ¯ Identify strengths and weaknesses of data structures.**

Cycle Entries
-------------

In this problem, we need to **remove the first element of a sequence**
and **add it to the end**.

An implementation using a Python list could look like this:

.. code:: python3

   from random import random

   def front_to_end(data):
       elem = data.pop(0)
       data.append(elem)

   N = 100
   data = [random() for i in range(N)]
   front_to_end(data)


Measure time behavior
---------------------

This operation looks harmless. Is it?

Use the ``timeit`` module to find out how long it runs. The following
code sniplet prints out the time needed:

.. code:: python3

   from timeit import timeit

   t = timeit('front_to_end(data)', globals=locals())
   print(f"time used: {t:6.3}")

Now scale up N (by adding one or more zeros) and see how the time
changes.


Using a Chained List
--------------------

Letâ€™s try an alternative data struture: the **chained list**. In a
chained list, each element points to the next element in the chain (or
``None`` if it is the last element in the chain).

It is common to keep the first and last element of a chain in extra
variables. Here is a Python implementation using classes:

.. code:: python3

   class ChainElement:

       def __init__(self, val):
           self.value = val
           self.next = None


   class ChainedList:
       """Helper class to manage the elements of a chain"""

       def __init__(self, n):
           self.first = ChainElement(random())
           self.last = self.first

           for i in range(n-1):
               self.last.next = ChainElement(random())
               self.last = self.last.next

       def front_to_end(self):
           """move the first element of the chain to the end"""
           ...

   # create a chained list
   chain = ChainedList(N)
   chain.front_to_end()


The Challenge
-------------

-  implement the ``front_to_end()`` method so that it does an operation
   equivalent to the list function above
-  measure the time required for ``front_to_end()`` (without creating
   the chain)
-  try different values of N and compare the result to the list-based
   implementation
-  what are the pros and cons of either implementation?
