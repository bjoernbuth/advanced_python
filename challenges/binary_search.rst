Binary Search
=============

**ðŸŽ¯ Measure the performance of an algorithm.**

A search problem
----------------

Suppose you have a list of 1 million numbers:

.. code:: python3

   from random import randint, seed

   seed(42)
   N = 1_000_000
   ids = [randint(1_000_000, 9_000_000) for i in range(N)]

We want to know at which position the number ``8997173`` occurs â€“ or
whether it occurs at all.


Brute-force solution
--------------------

Of course, you could loop through all the numbers:

.. code:: python3

   def search(query, ids):
       """brute-force search"""
       for i in ids:
           if i == query:
               return i
       return -1

   search(8997173, ids)

Because of the ``for`` loop, the time cost of this function grows
**linearly**. If you search twice as much data, it will take twice as
long. The **Big-O-Notation** for this would be O(N).


Recursive solution
------------------

An alternative approach is **binary search**, one of the most
fundamental recursive algorithms:

.. code:: python3

   def binary_search(query, ids, start, stop):
       """recursive binary search"""
       if ids[start] == query:
           return start
       elif stop - start <= 1:
           return -1

       split = start + (stop - start) // 2
       if ids[split] > query:
           return binary_search(query, ids, start, split)
       else:
           return binary_search(query, ids, split, stop)

   ids.sort()
   binary_search(8997173, ids, 0, len(ids))

The function requires the data to be sorted. The search itself runs in
**O(log N)** or **logarithmic** time. If you search twice as much data,
only one extra recursion is necessary.

Challenge
---------

Measure the time it takes both algorithms to run on 1 million numbers.
In IPython/Jupyter, you can use the magic function ``%time``:

.. code:: ipython3

   In [2]: %time search(8997173, ids)

Compare the time required by the brute-force and binary implementations.
Then increase the size of the data by factor 10 and repeat the
measurement.

Questions
~~~~~~~~~

-  Which of the searches is faster?
-  How much time does the sorting take?
-  When does binary search pay off?
-  For what data would the brute-force algorithm be faster?
