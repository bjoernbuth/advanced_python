# Sorting Algorithms

**ðŸŽ¯ Try several sorting algorithms.**

Sorting algorithms are among the most fundamental algorithms of all. In this exercise, you will gain a basic understanding of some of these algorithms.

**This is an offline exercise.**

## Material

* a deck of 20 playing cards per group (2-3 participants)
* the pseudocode of the 4 algorithms
* a stopwatch
* paper to write down the time

## Instructions

* read the algorithm description carefully
* shuffle the deck of cards
* start the stopwatch
* execute one of the algorithms
* stop the clock as soon as all the cards are sorted

### Selection Sort

1. lay the cards in a row in front of you
2. take the card with the smallest number and put it on the target pile
3. repeat step 2 until all cards are sorted

### Insertion Sort

1. take a card from the pile and lay it out in front of you
2. if there are already cards there, insert the new card in the correct position
3. repeat steps 1 and 2 until all cards are sorted

### Bubblesort

1. lay out all cards in a row in front of you
2. go through the cards from left to right
3. if there is a smaller card to the right of a larger one, swap both cards
4. repeat steps 2 and 3 until nothing changes in one pass

### Mergesort

1. divide the deck of cards into two equal piles
2. sort each pile according to the mergesort method
3. turn both piles upside down so that the smallest card is visible
4. place the smaller card from one of the piles on the target pile
5. Repeat step 4 until all cards are sorted.


## Optionale Goals

* repeat the exercise with a small (10) and a large (20) deck of cards
* implement one of the algorithms
* measure the runtime with `%timeit`.
